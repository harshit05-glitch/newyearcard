    <h1>For you pooks<3</h1>

    <p> HAPPPY NEW YEAR MI AMOR, please sit down and read this letter that i wrote for you for this day. </p></br>


        As I sit down to make this letter and code, my heart is filled with loads of emotions that words can hardly describe.</br>
        From the moment we met, my life has been touched by the extraordinary warmth and joy you bring.</br>
        So, i'm writing this letter for you to appreciate you and wish you New Year</br></br>
        
        I still remember our very first talk on discord and interactions on twitter, interacting with you on twitter has always been fun.</br>
        I wanna thank you so much for helping me with stuff since we met, i wanna thank you for making the past few months bearable;
        I wanna thank you for spending time with me evn though im hard to be around unlike others.</br>
        I remember each of our moments and cherish them so much.</br></br>

        I am not gonna lie when i say this, you have helped me ALOT, its hard to even get started, be it with my insecurities or anything.</br>
        You made me believe again that there's always gonna be good, I wake up in the morning thanking God for people and everything that i have</br></br>
        
        I everyday think about our fun moments and dont forget the voice notes, i still listen to them when i miss you.</br>
        I always look out for us hanging out, watching anything with you, playing games with you or just being otp with you makes me happy like sleeping otp.</br>
        I have always found heartfelt comfort in your presence, you have helped me gain confidence.</br>
        Everyday i wake up and want to share everything about my day with you, because i love talking to you and you love listening to my stuff.</br></br>

        I love you more and more with each passing day, i am always here for you like you have been for me, dont ever feel like you are alone.</br></br>

        We have our moments of arguements, we cant really call them arguements becausewe talk them out later on and this is what I love the most about us.</br></br>

        As I end this small card, i just hope you forgive me for my bad moments and hope such small things dont ruin anything between us.</br>
        You havent been feeling well lately, need your space and everything and im ready to give it everytime, just ask for it (slow at taking hints)</br>
        And, please never hide anything form me, if you are sad tell me about it, if something's on your mind tell me about, im always here for you; dont go through stuff alone.</br>
        I wish the best happens to you in not just 2024 but the years ahead of it.</br>
        I wanna write so much more but it wouldnt look good and words arent enough for it.</br>
        I LOVE YOU SO MUCH POOKS.</br></br>

        With all my love to you.
    </p>
