    <h1>For you pooks<3</h1>

    
    <p> For the first week of january </p></br>

       *edit on 7/1/24*
        pooks i know i have been very exhausting of a friend lately and i feel like something has changed between us because of that I really hope nothing changed tho.</br>
        i feel like something has changed bc we dont have hangout like before ykwim? we would watch 4 eps of shows and play for some time, ik im not better than your friends, but it is what it is </br>
        i just want us to spend enough time tg but ik u get bored with me, i wanna talk to you but we stopped doing that for some reason idky, where am i lacking pls lmk, how can i get better</br?
        i have a feeling something did but i wont ask you for reassureance bc u dont owe me anything like you say, so im gonna believe nothing has changed :)</br>
        I know im a very clingy, annoying person all the time but i just want to be there for you, i know i havent respected your boundaries and that has made you lose </br>
        some feelings for me and thats fine i cant change whats happened and i already got paid for it, i cant say it to your face or otp but the reason</br>
        i have been crying for the past days is because of whatever happened otp before we started tokyo drift, bc it felt like i had lost you and i never want that to happen</br>
        but thanks for helping me cry i needed that tbh even though it hurt alot</br>
        my life is better with you in it, it is better when you are happy </br>
        I know you have been going through stuff and the last night thing really hurt you, so if you need anything im always here, it might sound like im tryna be clingy or something but no</br>
        its just that i feel useless of a friend when i cant help them.</br>
        i wanna say a lot more but i dont think its the right time for it ill say it when the times ready</br></br>
        in the end for this week i would want to say that, please forgive me for not respecting your boundaries pls forgive me for always being so clingy and annoying </br>
        im trying to change for the better, I LOVE YOU ENOUGH TO RID MYSELF OF ANYTHING THAT HURTS YOU, pls just sometimes everything will workout and will be alright </br>
        
        
        I REALLY REALLY LOVE YOU POOKS, ALWAYS STAY HERE
        EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE ALRIGHT SOONER OR LATER, PLS DONT GIVE UP EVER, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT YOU AROUND;
        With all my love to you.
