    <h1>my last edit (i thought i would edit it 52 times in an year)<3</h1>

    <p>hey pooks, idk if youll read this whole thing or not, but thanks alot for making the few months of our peak memorable, i remember even the smallest of the smallest stuff; be it what you would say while driving or tha one day when yu were covering two car parking spots with just your car and what not</br>
       im glad we could enjoy every moment until then, iam really sorry for the fallout that happened and thanks for forgiving me for it.</br>
       i never expected fallout, if just if we could do it all over again (even just the friendship or besties) and correctly this time, i would do it all over again</br>
       keeping both of our healths in check, but thats your call, i realised and self reflected on myself on various stuff about me</br>
       and i feel like we both needed the break, that time it just wasnt the right time for both of us, i wish it was (it can be now or later on i pray so)</br>
       so if you ever plan or change your mind about us not talking anymore you know where to find me <br>
       i wish i could express how much i loved you and still do (i ranted paragraphs and vns about it in vardhan's dm that day) <br><br>

       i know this is smaller than other ones, but even as the last message this is all i could add, because i know you dont wanna hold a convo right now<br>
       just know pooks, i never hated you even after what you said, because i deserved it and thanks for forgiving me.
       i hope you become the best version of yourself be it with me or without me, i wish you nothing but happiness.
       i used to pray for you, still and will do in the future, i wish for the best of you, thanks for the lovely moments for the past few months, i hope you read this full<br>

       I loved you and i love you pooks, thanks:))  i really wish we could do it all over again and the right way this time.
