    <h1>For you pooks<3</h1>

    
    <p> HAPPPY NEW YEAR MI AMOR, please sit down and read this letter that i wrote for you for this day. </p></br>


        As I sit down to make this letter and code, my heart is filled with loads of emotions that words can hardly describe.</br>
        From the moment we met, my life has been touched by the extraordinary warmth and joy you bring.</br>
        So, i'm writing this letter for you to appreciate you and wish you New Year</br></br>
        
        I still remember our very first talk on discord and interactions on twitter, interacting with you on twitter has always been fun.</br>
        I wanna thank you so much for helping me with stuff since we met, i wanna thank you for making the past few months bearable;
        I wanna thank you for spending time with me evn though im hard to be around unlike others.</br>
        I remember each of our moments and cherish them so much.</br></br>

        I am not gonna lie when i say this, you have helped me ALOT, its hard to even get started, be it with my insecurities or anything.</br>
        You made me believe again that there's always gonna be good, I wake up in the morning thanking God for people and everything that i have</br></br>
        
        I everyday think about our fun moments and dont forget the voice notes, i still listen to them when i miss you.</br>
        I always look out for us hanging out, watching anything with you, playing games with you or just being otp with you makes me happy like sleeping otp.</br>
        I have always found heartfelt comfort in your presence, you have helped me gain confidence.</br>
        Everyday i wake up and want to share everything about my day with you, because i love talking to you and you love listening to my stuff.</br></br>

        I love you more and more with each passing day, i am always here for you like you have been for me, dont ever feel like you are alone.</br></br>
        *edit on 7/1/24*
        pooks i know i have been very exhausting of a friend lately and i feel like something has changed between us because of that I really hope nothing changed tho.</br>
        I know im a very clingy, annoying person all the time but i just want to be there for you, i know i havent respected your boundaries and that has made you lose </br>
        some feelings for me and thats fine i cant change whats happened and i already got paid for it, i cant say it to your face or otp but the reason</br>
        i have been crying for the past days is because of whatever happened otp before we started tokyo drift, bc it felt like i had lost you and i never want that to happen</br>
        my life is better with you in it, it is better when you are happy </br>
        I know you have been going through stuff and the last night thing really hurt you, so if you need anything im always here, it might sound like im tryna be clingy or something but no</br>
        its just that i feel useless of a friend when i cant help them.</br>
        i wanna say a lot more but i dont think its the right time for it ill say it when the times ready</br></br>
        in the end for this week i would want to say that, please forgive me for not respecting your boundaries pls forgive me for always being so clingy and annoying </br>
        im trying to change for the better, I LOVE YOU ENOUGH TO RID MYSELF OF ANYTHING THAT HURTS YOU, pls just sometimes everything will workout and will be alright </br>
        
        
        I REALLY REALLY LOVE YOU POOKS, ALWAYS STAY HERE
        EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE ALRIGHT SOONER OR LATER, PLS DONT GIVE UP EVER, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT YOU AROUND;
        With all my love to you.
    </p>
